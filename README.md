# My Personal Project

## Quoridor 

This application is an implementation similar to the board game - ***Quoridor***. Anyone can use it to play with a bot or multiplayer. This project is interesting to me because I'm enthusiastic about strategy game. There are a lot of modifications about the rules. 

- As one of the players, I want to add a block into my list of blocks in the game state.
- As a user, I want to view the current game board to see the list of blocks that two players has placed .
- As a user, I want to move my piece.
- As a user, I want to randomly displace a block
- As a user, I want to be able to save my game to file (if I so choose)
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my game from file (if I so choose)
